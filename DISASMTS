1   I read the article on the disassembler by Alan Field in the
 February issue of Technical Support.  I have used the disassembler
 mentioned in the article (from file 217 of the CBT).  There are
 several things about this disassembler that I thought could be improved.
 For example, I wanted the disassembler listing to look as much like the
 original assembler list as possible.  The disassembler did allow DSECTs
 to be defined, but you had to code statements to do this yourself.
 Some parameters were entered via the "PARM" on the execute statement,
 others by SYSIN type statements.  There were some fixed size tables
 that could fill up.
0   I wrote a new disassembler, borrowing from the one on the CBT.  The
 new program produces a listing very similar to assembler output.  DSECTs
 are defined by using the actual dsect source or macro.  There are no
 hardcoded fixed size tables that may fill up.  All control parameters
 are entered via "SYSIN" type statements.  I admitted up front that there
 would be problems that would be difficult to trouble shoot, so the
 program has a built in internal trace table.  There turned out to be
 so many internal control blocks that following the chains in a dump
 was very time consuming, so I wrote a "debug" program to run the chains
 and format the data at specific points.
0   Whereas the "old" disassembler consisted of 3 modules, mine has 13.
 The individual CSECTs are:
             DISASM00 - common data and trace table code
             DISASM01 - mainline
             DISASM02 - parameter reader/converter
             DISASM03 - object code reader
             DISASM04 - ESD data processor
             DISASM05 - RLD data processor
             DISASM06 - text printer
             DISASM07 - assembler interface/dsect interpreter
             DISASM08 - reference table builder
             DISASM09 - source code generator
             DISASMDB - debug
             DISASMOP - opcode table
             DISASMPR - printer
 Altogether the code comes to about 32K.
0   As in the "old" disassembler, extended mnemonics are used if possible
 for branch instructions.  SVC's are interpreted (the macro is not re-
 coded).  Control statements allow the definition of areas that do not
 contain instructions.  If the DISPUNCH DD is allocated, an 80-byte
 card type source deck will be produced that may be used as input to the
 assembler.
0   Labels generated for the disassembled CSECT have a form PPPPNNNN.
 If the label precedes an instruction, the PPPP is a 1 to 4 character
 user supplied prefix.  If the label preceeds a data area, PPPP is the
 literal "DATA".  NNNN is either the displacement into the CSECT where
 the label appears or is a sequentially assigned number (0010, 0020,
 etc).  Sequentially numbered labels may be more desirable if the source
 is to be modified because the label may no longer be at the same
 displacement.
0   If the disassembler can determine a label, it will use it in the
 generated source.  Instead of a MVC instruction always looking like:
 "MVC   324(18,R2),21(R3)", it might look like "MVC   FIELDB(18),FIELDA".
0   ENTRY points will be reproduced from the ESD data.  RLD items will
 cause an ADCON, VCON, Q, or CXD at the point the RLD item exists.
 ADCONs will cause a label to be generated at the point referenced by
 the ADCON.  VCONs and Q type items will have the name inserted:
 "DC  V(nnnnn)" or "Q(nnnnn)".
0   I tried to make the program as self documenting and as uncluttered
 as possible.  By breaking it up into multiple CSECTs functions could
 be isolated.  This kept base register problems to a minimum and allowed
 some isolation of testing individual components.
-                       PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
   STEP   MODULE
     1   DISASM01  Acquire trace table storage and initialize the trace
                   control data in DISASM00.
     2   DISASM01  Scan the TIOT to determine which DD's are present.
     3   DISASM01  Verify that all required DD's were present.
     4   DISASM01  Call the parameter reader, DISASM02.
     5   DISASM02  Read all control statements.  Each statement is
                   printed on the DISPRINT listing.  All parameters
                   set fields or flags in the common module, DISASM00.
     6   DISASM02  When end-of-file is reached on DISIN, verify that all
                   required parameters were entered.
     7   DISASM01  If there were errors detected by DISASM02, an error
                   message is issued and the program terminates.
     8   DISASM01  Acquire storage for object module I/O area.
     9   DISASM01  Call the ojbect module reader, DISASM03.
    10   DISASM03  Issue a BLDL for the specified module.
    11   DISASM03  If the BLDL was unsuccessful, interpret the return
                     A) interpret the BLDL return code
                     B) print an error message
                     C) set the abort flag
                     D) return to mainline
    12   DISASM03  Interpret data from the directory data (text's TTR,
                       entry point, module's length, etc).
    13   DISASM03  Issue a POINT to prepare for reading the module.
    14   DISASM03  If the POINT was unsuccessful
                     A) interpret the POINT return code
                     B) print an error message
                     C) set the abort flag
                     D) return to mainline
    15   DISASM03  Read records from the object module:
    16   DISASM03  If the record contains
                     A) CESD records, process them internally.  If this
                        is the requested CSECT's data, copy the data
                        into the storage acquired by DISASM04.
                     B) ESD data, call DISASM04 to process.
         DISASM04       DISASM04 interprets and prints the ESD data.
                        ESD info is saved in "ESDDATA" blocks chained
                        from the common data module, DISASM00.  If the
                        requested CSECT is found, acquire storage for
                        text, and set the "CSECT found" flag.
                     C) RLD data, call DISASM05 to process.
         DISASM05       DISASM05 interprets and prints RLD data.  RLD
                        info is saved in "RLDDATA" blocks chained from
                        the common data module, DISASM00.  DISASM05
                        verifies that the RLD items are not in an area
                        defined as data by DATA statements.  If an RLD
                        item is in a DATA area-
                             a) print an error message
                             b) set the abort flag
                        RLD items are checked to see if they reference
                        ESD items (like VCONs).  If an RLD item does
                        reference an ESD entry, the ESD item is linked
                        to the RLD item so the name can be generated.
    17   DISASM01  If there were errors detected by DISASM03, DISASM04,
                   or DISASM05, an error message is issued and the
                   program terminates.
    18   DISASM01  Call the object text printer DISASM06.
    19   DISASM06  Prints the object module in dump type format.
    20   DISASM01  Call the assembler interface and dsect interpreter,
                   DISASM07.
    21   DISASM07  If no assembler input was specified in the DISIN
                   parameters, issue a message and return to mainline.
    22   DISASM07  LOAD the assembler, IEV90.
    23   DISASM07  Link to the assembler.
    24   DISASM07  Print the assembler return code.
    25   DISASM07  Read the assembler listing -
                      A) when a DSECT is detected, add a new DSCTBLOK
                         to the chain (CSECT's are treated the same
                         as DSECT's).
                      B) when a label is detected add it to the label
                         chain from the current DSECT.
    26   DISASM08  Chain the USING blocks to the DSECT blocks they
                   refer to.
    27   DISASM08  Scan the object code and determine the displacements
                   where valid instructions occur. Generate DATA blocks
                   for any areas that do not contain instructions.
    28   DISASM08  Verify that all BASE and USINGs reference instruction
                   boundaries.
    29   DISASM08  Generate LABELs for ENTRY points in the requested
                   CSECT.
    30   DISASM08  Generate LABELs for ADCON references.
    31   DISASM08  Generate the reference table.  If the disassembler
                   can determine a label in the CSECT or a DSECT,
                   the "reference" will be the address of the LABEL
                   block and the displacement from that label.
